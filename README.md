# Modal Window Project

## Project Overview
The **Modal Window Project** is an interactive web application that demonstrates how to create and control modal windows using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It features a dynamic overlay, a modal dialog box, and responsive buttons for showing and closing the modal. The modal provides an aesthetically pleasing interface with a transparent background and smooth user interactions.

## Features

### **Responsive Design**
- Dynamically displays a modal window when any **"Show modal"** button is clicked.
- Closes the modal when:
  - Clicking the close button.
  - Clicking on the overlay.
  - Pressing the **Escape** key.

### **Styling**
- **Modern, minimalistic design** inspired by 2024 web standards.
- Transparent overlay with a blur effect for better user experience.
- Smooth transitions and clean typography.

### **JavaScript Integration**
- Event-driven programming with `addEventListener` for seamless functionality.
- Keyboard interactivity using the **Escape** key to close the modal.

## Code Breakdown

### 1. **HTML**
The HTML structure includes:
- Three buttons (`show-modal`) for opening the modal.
- The modal dialog box, which includes:
  - A close button.
  - Heading and paragraph content.
- An overlay for dimming the background.

### 2. **CSS**
The CSS provides:
- A gradient background with a clean and vibrant design.
- Hidden modal functionality using the `.hidden` class.
- Styling for the modal, overlay, buttons, and typography.

**Key classes**:
- `.hidden`: Used to hide elements dynamically.
- `.modal`: Styled as a centered dialog box.
- `.overlay`: Semi-transparent background with a blur effect.

### 3. **JavaScript**
The JavaScript code:
- Uses query selectors to target elements for interaction.
- Implements event listeners for buttons and keyboard inputs.
- Controls the visibility of the modal and overlay with the `.hidden` class.

## How It Works

1. **Click on any "Show modal" button**:
   - The modal and overlay appear with smooth transitions.
   
2. **Interact with the modal**:
   - Close it using the `Ã—` button, clicking on the overlay, or pressing the **Escape** key.
   
3. **Observe the console**:
   - Log outputs display user interactions (e.g., "Button Clicked").

## Customization

### **Add More Buttons**

## Future Enhancements

- Make the modal content dynamic (e.g., load different content for each button).
- Improve accessibility for screen readers.
